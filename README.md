# infracost GitHub action

This action runs [infracost](https://github.com/aliscott/infracost) on the provided terraform directory. It can be used to automatically add a PR comment showing the cost estimate `diff` between a pull request and the master branch whenever a `.tf` file changes.

## Inputs

### `file_prefix`

**Required** The file prefix used to save the infracost output.

## Environment variables

The AWS secrets mentioned below are used by terraform init and plan commands. As mentioned in the repo [readme](../../../README.md): you can run `infracost` in your terraform directories without worrying about security or privacy issues as no terraform secrets/tags/IDs etc are sent to the pricing service (only generic price-related attributes are used). Also, do not be alarmed by seeing the `terraform init` in output, no changes are made to your terraform or cloud resources. As a security precaution, read-only AWS IAM creds can be used.

### `TERRAFORM_DIR`

**Required** Path of the repo's terraform directory.

### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

**Required** AWS access key ID is used by terraform init and plan commands.

### `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

**Required** AWS secret access key is used by terraform init and plan commands.

## Outputs

### `monthly_cost`

The monthly cost estimate.

## Usage

1. [Add repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to your GitHub repo. As a security precaution, read-only AWS IAM creds can be used.

2. Create a new file in `.github/workflows/infracost.yml` in your repo with the following content. You should only need to modify the `TERRAFORM_DIR` value, everything else should work out of the box.
```

  push:
    paths:
    - '**.tf'
jobs:
  infracost:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Show infracost diff
    env:
      TERRAFORM_DIR: MY/PATH/HERE
